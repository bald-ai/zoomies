# Zoomies

_Take and copy paste screen in 2 seconds. Rename? 3 seconds. Rename + annotate with prompt for agent? 5 seconds. Quick edit? 7? maybe 10..._

> **Requires macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later.** If you have an older macOS version, it is probably best to use this as a product spec and build your own. I had enough headaches with older OS versions already.

Mac-only keyboard-first screenshot and scratchpad app for agentic coding.
Good for touchpad users too, especially if your wrist is already cooked from gaming.

Fork it, pork it, change it, rebuild it. Have fun.

## What It Does

- Captures the exact UI state you want a coding agent to understand.
- Adds quick notes/prompts to screenshots so the context travels with the image.
- Creates quick scratchpad notes for errors, issues, and ideas you spot in one project while your head is still in another.
- Lets you rename, annotate, save, copy, or delete without breaking coding flow.
- Reopens a selected Finder image and sends it back through the Zoomies flow.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd zoomies_swift
swift build
swift run Zoomies
```

This repo is source-only. If you want a clickable `.app`, ask any coding agent to package the SwiftPM project into a macOS app bundle for you.

## Default Shortcuts

- `Option+Shift+4` -> area capture
- `Option+Shift+3` -> full-screen capture
- `Option+Shift+2` -> select an image in Finder, press this to edit/rename it with Zoomies
- `Option+Shift+5` -> create a scratchpad note

The defaults intentionally avoid the standard macOS `Cmd+Shift` screenshot shortcuts.

## Workflow Keybinds

| Screen | Key | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rename / Prompt | `Enter` | Save |
| Rename / Prompt | `Cmd+Enter` | Copy + save |
| Rename / Prompt | `Cmd+Backspace` | Copy + delete |
| Rename / Prompt | `Esc` | Delete / close |
| Flow | `Tab` | Next step |
| Flow | `Shift+Tab` | Previous step |
| Edit | `W` / `A` / `R` / `E` / `T` / `S` | Pen / arrow / rectangle / ellipse / text / select |
| Edit | `K` or `Q` | Open colors |
| Edit | `1-6` | Pick color |
| Edit | `Cmd+Z` | Undo |
| Edit | `Option+Backspace` | Clear |
| Edit | `Cmd+C` / `Cmd+X` / `Cmd+V` | Copy / cut / paste |
| Edit | `Cmd +` / `Cmd -` / `Cmd 0` | Zoom in / out / reset |
| Edit | `Enter` | Save |
| Edit | `Cmd+Enter` | Copy + save |
| Edit | `Esc` | Cancel |

## Permissions

The app uses `ScreenCaptureKit` (`SCScreenshotManager`) for all screen capture. macOS will prompt once for Screen Recording permission.

- **Screen Recording** (for screenshots via ScreenCaptureKit)
- **Automation / Finder** (for reopening flow on selected Finder image via `Option+Shift+2`)

## TODO

- Make a video demonstration?
- Make a screen demonstration?
- Add a donation option and create a `$1` validation flow?
